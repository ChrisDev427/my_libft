# my_libft
The libft project at school 42 is a fundamental step aimed at creating a C programming language library called "libft."
This library provides a set of useful functions for further project development at the school.

The main goal of the project is to allow students to solidify their programming knowledge
in C and master the basic concepts of manipulating strings, arrays, and pointers.
They must also understand and apply concepts such as memory management, data structures, and file operations.

The libft library contains functions that cover various areas, such as string operations (copying, concatenation, searching, etc.),
array manipulation (sorting, searching, insertion, etc.), memory management (allocation, deallocation),
character manipulation, data type conversion, basic mathematical operations, file operations, and more.

Students are also required to include thorough testing for each function to ensure their proper functionality and robustness.
This involves writing test cases to cover all possible scenarios and verifying that the functions behave correctly in all situations.

In summary, school 42's libft project is a crucial step that allows students to create their own function library in the C programming language.
It helps them strengthen their programming skills, master the fundamentals, and develop a deep understanding of
common manipulations of strings, arrays, and pointers.
