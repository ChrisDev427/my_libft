# my_libft
My_libft project is my personalized version of the libft42 library, designed and developed throughout the projects I have completed at school 42.
I have worked on enhancing the original libft42 by adding new functions and improving existing ones to meet the specific requirements of each project.
It demonstrates my experience and proficiency in C programming, along with my ability to address the specific requirements of a project.
